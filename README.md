This script is ad-hoc solution for inspecting **MQTT over TLS** traffic. As far as I know Wireshark solves this problem but obtaining TLS master keys from IoT device might be a pain. Also you can log MQTT topics, just uncomment lines at the bottom of the `mqtt_message.py`.

## Usage

Run mitmproxy as `mitmproxy --mode transparent --tcp-hosts '.*' -s mqtt_message.py`. Messages will be displayed at the event log (press `shift + e`).

Of course before that you have to prepare a target device and your host running mitmproxy:
* Install mitmproxy's root certificate on a target device.
* Route device's traffic to mitmproxy. See https://docs.mitmproxy.org/stable/ for the details.
* https://docs.mitmproxy.org/stable/howto-transparent/.

If server requires x509 client authentication `--set client_certs=cert.pem` mitmproxy's option might be useful.

## Roadmap

- [x] [Add support for non-HTTP flows to the UI](https://github.com/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/1020).
- [ ] Implement parsing of MQTT packet types other than `CONNECT`, `PUBLISH` and `SUBSCRIBE`.
- [ ] Add support for MQTT to mitmproxy including interception, modification and replay.
